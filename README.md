## Data Structures

The following Data Structures are implemented in this repository:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap
- Hash Table
- Graph

Each Data Structure has its own directory and contains the implementation of all the basic operations along with some advanced operations. The implementation is done in multiple programming languages like C++, Java, Python, etc.

## Algorithms

The following Algorithms are implemented in this repository:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph Algorithms (Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm)

Each Algorithm has its own directory and contains the implementation of the algorithm in multiple programming languages. Along with the implementation, the time and space complexities of the algorithm are also mentioned.
